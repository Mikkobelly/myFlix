    <h1>myFlix API</h1>
    <p>
        “myFlix” application will provide users with access to information about different
        movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
        personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

    <p>
        The complete server-side of your web application, including the server, business logic,
        and business layers of the application. It will consist of a well-designed REST API and
        architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API
        will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to
        retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational
        way.
